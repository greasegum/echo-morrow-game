## Level 6: War Machine
*Based on "1227: Treatise on Nomadology"*

## Progression Mechanics

### Between-Level Transitions
- Each level completion unlocks new glyphs and communication methods
- Players carry forward "echo memory" that influences new environments
- Harmonic resonance builds across levels, creating cumulative understanding
- Previous level entities may appear as "guides" in new levels

### Meta-Progression
- **Philosophical Understanding**: Each level teaches a different philosophical concept from Deleuze and Guattari
- **Communication Evolution**: Players learn increasingly complex and abstract forms of communication
- **Consciousness Expansion**: From individual to collective to pure potential
- **Territory Mastery**: From local forest to infinite plane of immanence

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Each level can be implemented as a separate module extending the current architecture
- Visual and audio systems can be adapted for each environment
- Entity system can be expanded to handle the new philosophical concepts
- UI can evolve to reflect the changing nature of communication and understanding
